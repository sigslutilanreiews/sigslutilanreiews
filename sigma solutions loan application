While it may be uncomfortable to ask a friend or family member for money, doing so is often safe and affordable. You should only go this route if you’re confident that you can repay your loved one. Otherwise, you risk ruining your relationship with them.

If you do borrow from friends or family, put a formal agreement in writing and create a repayment timeline that you can both agree to. With a formal agreement in place, everyone will be on the same page, and there won’t be any confusion or uncertainty about the loan.
